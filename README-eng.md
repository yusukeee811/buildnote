## Site Overview
### Site Theme
"<b>buildnote</b>" is a specialized record-keeping SNS site designed for individuals engaged in training activities. <br>
It supports tracking and managing training records, facilitating the visualization of training progress, and fostering interaction among users engaged in training.
